The grammar in this directory is a somewhat enhanced/patched version of the regular examples/java/Java.javacc grammar that generates Node classes that implement the various interfaces in the jdk.compiler module of the JDK, specifically in the com.sun.source.tree package. This is experimental work that is incomplete and part of an experiment to see how hard it is to replace the handwritten Java parser use by javac with one generated by JavaCC 21.

For the time being, I cannot devote any more time to this little project and if anybody is interested in this, especially to the extent of working on it, they are free to do so. Feel free to get in contact with me at revusky (at) gmail (dot) com.
